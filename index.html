					<p>The first step in every project is discovery.</p> 

					<p>Understanding your industry, clients and stakeholders, goals, and challenges is key. We take the time to really scope out your needs, so that we can build a product together that’s powerful and effective. We look at the kinds of things your users ask for and need. And we look for inspiration – things that are meaningful, remarkable, and surprising in what you offer, and how we can best connect those things to your users.</p>
